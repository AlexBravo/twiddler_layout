// This data was authored by me
// The problem is that the symbols from the HID codes are ambiguous, especially after
// normalization from SymbolOverrides.tsv.
// Symbols stand for key-presses, and several keypresses accomplish the same conceptual thing.
// There is a lot of duplication between the keyboard and the keypad, also with international stuff.
// This duplication is nice for a full sized keyboard, but we want people to be able to define
// a chord mapping with as few symbols as possible, without restricting their options (remove redundancy).
// Where things are ambiguous, this file will make the decision about which is preferred
